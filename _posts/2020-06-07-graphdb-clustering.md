- Replication: Neo4j does allow writing through slaves, even then thatâ€™s being written to syncs with the master before returning to the client (writing through slaves works slower then writing directly to the master)
- Buffer writes using queues: this technique can be used in a high write load scenarios, in order to reduce contention. It enables to pause write operations without refusing client requests during maintenance periods.
- Global Clusters: Latency introduced by the physical separation of the regions can sometimes disrupt the coordination protocol. It is better to restrict master reelection by create slave-only databases
- Neo4j cluster, the full graph is replicated to each instance in the cluster

# Load Balancing
- Separate read traffic from write traffic. Writing traffic is forwarded to master while balancing the read traffic across the entire cluster
- Cache sharding. This technique is routing each request to a database instance in a HA cluster where the portion of the graph necessary to satisfy query is likely already in main memory
- Read your own writes

# Performance Optimization Options
- Increase JVM heap size
- Increase the percentage of the store mapped into the page caches
- Invest in faster disks: SSDs or enterprise flash hardware

# Redundancy
- Business-critical applications will likely require redundancy of at least two; that is, even after two machines have failed, the application continues serving requests
- Graph database whose cluster management protocol requires a majority of members to be available to work properly, redundancy of one can be achieved with three or four instances, and redundancy of two with five instances.

CAUTION!: Four is no better than three in this respect, because if two instances from a four-instance cluster become unavailable, the remaining coordinators will no longer be able to achieve majority.

# Load
```
number of concurrent requests = (1000 / average request time (in ms)) * number of cores per machine * number of machines
```

- Average request time: period from when a server receives a request, to when it sends a response
- Number of concurrent requests: recent production statistics with future estimated number of concurrent requests
