**Insertion sort**, which is an efficient algorithm for sorting a small number of elements. Insertion sort works the way many people do it by hand while playing a card game (*Though personally i would not sort the cards while playing, because there are too many skill-full guys, who may take an advantage of it*)

## Insertion sort

```
INSERTION-SORT(A):
for j = 2 to A.length
   key = A[j]
   // Insert A[j] into the sorted sequence A[1..j-1]
   i = j - 1
   while i > 0 and A[i] > key
      A[i + 1] = A[i]
      i = i - 1
   A[i + 1] = key
```

The black rectangle holds the key taken from A[j], which is compared with the values in shaded rectangles to its left. 

here formaly we call **Loop invariant**, when at the each iteration of for loop the subarray A[1..j-1] consists of the elements originally existed in A[1..j-1] subarray, but in sorted order.

## Analyzing algorithms
**Analyzing** an algorithm has come to mean predicting the resources that the algorithm requires.

The running time of the algorithm is the sum of running times for each statement executed.

**Simplifying abstraction:** it is the **rate of growth**, or **order of growth**, of the running time that really intersts us. We therefore consider only the leading term of a formula (e.g.,*an^2*), since the lower-order terms are relatively insignificant for large values of *n*. We also ignore the leading termâ€™s constant coefficient, since constant factors are less significant than the rate of growth in determining computational efficiency for large inputs.

We write that insertion sort has a worst-case running time of Theta(n^2).
